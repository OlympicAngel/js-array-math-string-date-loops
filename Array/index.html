    <p>53. Write a JavaScript program to count the number of arrays inside a given array.

        Test Data :
        [2,8,[6],3,3,5,3,4,[5,4]] -> 2
        [2,8,[6,3,3],[4],5,[3,4,[5,4]]] -> 3
        Expected Output:
        Number of arrays inside the said array: 2
        Number of arrays inside the said array: 3
        <button onclick="task53()"></button>
    </p>

    <p>
        52. Write a JavaScript program to get all the indexes where NaN is found in a given array of numbers and NaN.

        Test Data :
        ([2, NaN, 8, 16, 32]) -> [1]
        ([2, 4, NaN, 16, 32, NaN]) -> [2,5]
        ([2, 4, 16, 32]) ->[]
        Expected Output:
        Original array: 2,NaN,8,16,32
        Find all indexes of NaN of the said array: 1
        Original array: 2,4,NaN,16,32,NaN
        Find all indexes of NaN of the said array: 2,5
        Original array: 2,4,16,32
        Find all indexes of NaN of the said array:
        <button onclick="task52()"></button>
    </p>

        51. Write a JavaScript program to check if an array is a factor chain or not.

        A factor chain is an array in which the previous element is a factor of the next consecutive element. The
        following is a
        factor chain:
        [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]
        // 2 is a factor of 4
        // 4 is a factor of 8
        // 8 is a factor of 16
        // 16 is a factor of 32

        Test Data :
        ([2, 4, 8, 16, 32]) -> true
        ([2, 4, 16, 32, 64]) -> true
        ([2, 4, 16, 32, 68]) -> false
        Expected Output:
        Original array:
        Check the said array is a factor chain or not?
        true
        Original array:
        Check the said array is a factor chain or not?
        true
        Original array:
        Check the said array is a factor chain or not?
        false
        <button onclick="task51()"></button>
    </p>

    <p>
        50. Write a JavaScript program that takes an array with mixed data type and calculates the sum of all numbers.

        Test Data :
        ([2, "11", 3, "a2", false, 5, 7, 1]) -> 18
        ([2, 3, 0, 5, 7, 8, true, false]) -> 25
        Expected Output:
        Original array: 2,11,3,a2,false,5,7,1
        Sum all numbers of the said array: 18
        Original array: 2,3,0,5,7,8,true,false
        Sum all numbers of the said array: 25
        <button onclick="task50()"></button>
    </p>

    <p>
        49. Write a JavaScript program that takes an array of numbers and returns the third smallest number.

        Test Data :
        (2,3,5,7,1) -> 3
        (2,3,0,5,7,8,-2,-4) -> 0
        Expected Output:
        Original array of numbers: 2,3,5,7,1
        Third smallest number of the said array of numbers: 3
        Original array of numbers: 2,3,0,5,7,8,-2,-4
        Third smallest number of the said array of numbers: 0
        <button onclick="task49()"></button>
